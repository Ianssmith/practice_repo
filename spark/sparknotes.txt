spark

mapreduce lots of boilerplate
only java 
no repl
only batch
disk (slow)
not optimized for iterative processing
no graph processing

spark
memory based
batch and stream
good at iterative
supports graph processing

resource managers / cluster manager
yarn
mesos (not widely used)
standalone
kubernetes (deployment)

spark uses master slave structure
called driver (master)
worker (slaves) nodes have many executors (small execution in spark)

___mvnrepository.com___

collect()
all data from all executers will come to the driver program which could likely lead to an out of memory error
'what might cause an out of memory error in spark'

execution modes
client mode
    driver program runs on client machine
cluster mode

transforms lazy (eg flatmap map)
    if it is returning a new rdd ( Resilient Distributed Dataset)
        narrow transform has no shuffling
        wide transformation does have shuffling (optimization:avoid if possible) 
actions eager
    returns other stuff arrays
