-what is an sql index? how does it work?
-what are sql window functions?
performs a calculation over a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row
differs from aggregate and groupby in that you don't have to group rows of data into a single output row
so rows get to retain their separate identity
they operate on chosen rows by a partition or frame using the "over()" clause in a select statement and partition by
-difference between rank and dense rank?
rank will skip over subsequent numbers in the ranking if there are duplicates ie 1,2,3,3,5,6,7
dense rank will not skip ranking numbers after duplicates ie 1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7
